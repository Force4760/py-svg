# Py SVG

Py svg will be a python library for generative art using SVG.

## SVG

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a markup Language to create vectors that allows for animation.

SVG's can be made in tools like **Figma**, **Adobe Ilustrator**, or **Inkscape**, but it can also be coded just like *HTML*

## Inspiration

This library was inspired by other generative art and creative coding tools like **[Processing](https://processing.org/)**, **[P5JS](https://p5js.org/)** and **[Celestine](https://github.com/celestinecr/celestine/)**
